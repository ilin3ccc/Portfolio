# Formula One - Data Analytics Demonstration

## 1. F1 DRIVERS - An Exploratory Analysis

With this first [SQL-Python-Cloud demonstration](https://github.com/ilin3ccc/Portfolio/blob/main/3.%20SQL-Python-Cloud%20Database/F1%20DRIVERS.ipynb), we will be looking at drivers.csv from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). 

We generated the following insights:

- Top 10 nationalities of F1 drivers (visualization included)
- Drivers who represented Canada
- Who are the youngest drivers in F1
- Current roster of official drivers and their drive numbers
