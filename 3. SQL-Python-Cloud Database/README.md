# Formula One - Data Analytics Demonstration

F1 CONSTRUCTOR - Descriptive Analytics for Better Results

In this [First SQL-Python-Cloud demonstration](https://github.com/ilin3ccc/Portfolio/blob/main/3.%20SQL-Python-Cloud%20Database/F1%20CONSTRUCTORS.ipynb), we look at a this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) as an **enterprise**. The ability for companies to know 'what happened?' is the basis for good decision-making. We can learn much from a successful business, such as Red Bull, by analyzing it's related F1 statistics. We will be focusing on Red Bull drivers' 2018 performance, and how it affects overall constructor results/standings.  

We were able to draw meaningful insights by joining the following csv files:

- results.csv
- races.csv
- drivers.csv
- constructors.csv
- constructor_results.csv
- circuits.csv
