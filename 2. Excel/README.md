# Excel - Data Cleaning 

We perform Data-Cleaning functions on a [Raw Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data) obtained from Kaggle:

- Made all data visible by adjusting column widths.
- Removed empty rows.
- Removed duplicates.
- Sorted data based on Order Number (column A) from smallest to largest.
- Formatted column B to allow for appropriate decimal places.
- Replaced all the double spaces "  ", with a single space " " by Find/Replace function.

# Excel - Visualizations

We utilize Pivot Table on the cleaned dataset to generate 4 relevant data visualizations.

- Sales By Year - Total sales of given dataset, broken-down by year. <br/>
- Sales By Territory - Total sales, broken-down by territory. <br/>
- Automobiles Sales - Sales of only 'Automobiles' category from the product line (excluding planes, ships, and trains).<br/>
- Canadian Sales 2004 - Drilled down representation of sales generated from Canada in year 2004, further broken down by product categories.<br/>
