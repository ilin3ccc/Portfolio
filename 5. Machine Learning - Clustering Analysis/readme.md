# Online Shop 2024 - Exploratory & Prescriptive Analytics  

## Overview  
This [project](https://github.com/ilin3ccc/Portfolio/blob/main/5.%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Clustering%20Analysis/onlineshop2024_clustering.ipynb) uses clustering techniques to derive actionable insights into supplier performance, spend behaviors, and risk management. By analyzing supplier data, we aim to enhance procurement strategies and streamline supply chain operations. 

## Key Highlights  

### Supplier Performance Segmentation  
- **Purpose**: Identify supplier clusters based on performance metrics (lead time, total spend, spend frequency, and cost variability).  
- **Outcome**: Three distinct supplier profiles with tailored strategic recommendations for procurement optimization.

### Spend Behavior Analysis  
- **Purpose**: Cluster suppliers by spending patterns to uncover cost-saving opportunities.  
- **Outcome**: Development of three supplier profiles based on spend behaviors, enhancing procurement efficiency.

### Supplier Risk Assessment  
- **Purpose**: Evaluate shipping statuses (including canceled transactions) to manage supplier risks effectively.  
- **Outcome**: Suppliers categorized into Low, Medium, and High-risk profiles with corresponding mitigation strategies.

### Practical Application  
This project aligns with enterprise objectives by consolidating analyses across subdivisions, offering a cohesive and strategic view of supplier management. Recommendations are tailored for procurement teams to address performance gaps, reduce costs, and mitigate risks.
