# Predictive Spend Analysis - Regression Project

## Overview
This [project](./4.%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Regression%20Analysis/FarmPSA.ipynb) uses a Linear Regression model to predict **spending** based on factors like market price, sales volume, and time patterns (e.g., month, day of the week). The goal is to provide actionable insights for budgeting and procurement planning.

## Key Highlights
- **Purpose:** Forecast spending trends to support better resource allocation and financial planning.
- **Scope:** The model performs well for smaller spending amounts (â‰¤ 200,000), making it particularly useful for routine budgeting decisions.
- **Practical Application:** Helps procurement teams anticipate future expenses based on market dynamics and historical trends.

## Limitations
- The model shows variability in predictions for higher spending amounts (> 200,000), often underestimating actual values. Additional features or advanced models could improve accuracy.
